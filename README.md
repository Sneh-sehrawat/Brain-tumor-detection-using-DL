This project aims to revolutionize brain tumor detection by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to assist neurosurgeons in making rapid and accurate decisions. Utilizing a database of 7,000 images, we explored various neural network models, including InceptionV3, MobileNet, and ResNet, achieving accuracies of 49%, 60%, and 80% respectively. These models are designed to analyze MRI and CT scans with high precision, significantly improving early diagnosis and treatment outcomes. By automating and enhancing the diagnostic process, our deep learning-based approach has the potential to greatly improve patient care and reduce mortality rates associated with brain and CNS cancer.
